# Description: This is an example script that you can author or modify that retrieves 
#              a list of Azure Virtual Machines from the Relay Interface (in the form of parameters)
#              and filters the VMs that have no tags. It then sets the output variable `resourceIDs` 
#              to the list of Azure Virtual Machines resource IDs that are untagged. 
# Inputs:
#   - virtualMachines - list of Azure Virtual Machines
# Outputs:
#   - resourceIDs - list of Azure Virtual Machine resource IDs to be terminated in the subsequent step
